### In your lovely openSUSE, you can add, delete and manage your Software Repositories through powerful and wonderful YaST.


```
Kickoff menu -> Computer tab -> YaST -> Software -> Software Repositories
```


#### Our SUSE has added some offical Software Repositories, they are stable and safe.But we also can add some own non-offical Software Repositories for our personal needs.



### But do pay attention to:

>* Non-offical Software Repositories may contain some unstable software package.
>* Different Software Repositories may not compatible with each other.
>* A non-offical Software Repositories may not be permanently stable and reliable.

#### Too much Software Repositories will slow down the speed of software package management.



#### At first, let me tell you a simple way to auto search and add your "Community Repositories"(Which is the most safe and simple way to add Software Repositories):


```
Kickoff menu -> Computer tab -> YaST -> software -> Software Repositories -> Clikc on "Add" -> select "Community Repositories" and click "Next".
```


###In managing your Software Repositories, your have to keep these three offical Software Repositories:

>* Main Repository(OSS)
>* Main Repository(NON-OSS)
>* Main Update Repository

#### For Chinese Users, offical Software Repositories may be a little slow. So you can choose your own Chinese mirrow Software Repositories, just like [http://mirrow.163.com/openSUSE/](http://mirrow.163.com/openSUSE/) or [http://mirrors.sohu.com/opensuse/](http://mirrors.sohu.com/opensuse/) and so on.



#### NOW, I use [http://mirrow.163.com/openSUSE/](http://mirrow.163.com/openSUSE/) and SUSE 12.3 as example.
```
Kickoff menu -> Computer tab -> YaST -> software -> Software Repositories -> Clikc on "Add" -> Select "Specify URL..."
```

#### then input following things in the input boxes:
